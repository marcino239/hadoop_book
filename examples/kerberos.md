## kinit
```bash
kinit
kinit PRINCIPAL
kinit -kt ${KEYTAB}.keytab
kinit -kt ${KEYTAB}.keytab PRINCIPAL
```

## klist
```bash
klist
klist -kt ${KEYTAB}.keytab

# List encryption types
klist -e
klist -e -kt ${KEYTAB}.keytab
```

## Keytabs
A keytab must be treated like a password. Although it is not in clear text, having access to a keytab is the same as having your password since they can then impersonate you.

### Manually Creating Keytab (w/ password)
```bash
ktutil
```
```
add_entry -password -p principal@EXAMPLE.COM -k 3 -e aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96
write_kt
quit
```

#### Available Encryption Types
```
aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96
aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96
arcfour-hmac
des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc
```

You cannot specify the salt when using ktutil. What you need to do 
instead is to specify exactly the same principal that AD uses as salt. 

For machine accounts this salting principal is 
`host/sAMAccountname.domain_name@DOMAIN_NAME`
```
   sAMAccountname := the machines samaccountname without "$" 
   domain_name := name of AD domain name in lowercase 
   DOMAIN_NAME := name of AD domain name in uppercase 
```

For user accounts this salting principal is `username@DOMAIN_NAME`
```
username := first component of userPrincipalname or sAMAccountName if userPrincipalname attribute is not set
```
